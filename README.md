    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    While many expect that the use of advanced learning technologies like intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) will substitute for human teaching and thus reduce the influence of teachers on student outcomes, studies consistently show that outcomes vary substantially across teachers and schools (Pane et al. 2010; Pane et al. 2014; Ritter et al. 2007a; Koedinger et al. 1997; Koedinger and Sueker 2014). Despite these findings, there have been few efforts (e.g., Schofield 1995) to understand the mechanisms by which teacher practices influence student learning on such systems. We present analyses of Carnegie Learning’s Cognitive Tutor ITS data from a large school district in the southeastern United States, which present a variety of usage and implementation profiles that illuminate disparities in deployments in practical, day-to-day educational settings. We focus on differential effectiveness of teachers’ implementations and how implementations may drive learner efficiency in ITS usage, affecting long term learning outcomes. These results are consistent with previous studies of predictors and causes of learning outcomes for students using Cognitive Tutor. We provide recommendations for practitioners seeking to deploy intelligent learning technologies in real world settings.

    	abstract = {Simpliﬁed categorizations have often led to college students being labeled as full-time or part-time students. However, at many universities student enrollment patterns can be much more complicated, as it is not uncommon for students to alternate between full-time and part-time enrollment each semester based on ﬁnances, scheduling, or family needs. While prior research has established that fulltime students maintain better outcomes than their part-time counterparts, little study has examined the impact of mixed enrollment patterns on academic outcomes. In this paper, we apply a Hidden Markov Model to identify students’ enrollment strategies according to three diﬀerent categories: part-time, full-time, and mixed enrollment. According to the enrollment classiﬁcation we investigate and compare the academic performance outcomes of each group. Analysis of data collected from the University of Central Florida from 2008 to 2017 indicates that mixed enrollment students are closer in performance to full-time students, than parttime students. More importantly, during their part-time semesters, mixed-enrollment students signiﬁcantly outperform part-time students. Such a ﬁnding suggests that increased engagement through the occasional full-time enrollment leads to better overall outcomes.},

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this study, the academic performance of students from the E-Commerce department at Palestine Technical University – Kadoorie is predicted using a Markov chains model and educational data mining. Based on the complete data regarding the achievements of the students from the 2016 cohort of students obtained from the university’s admissions and registration department, a Markov chain is built, in which the states are divided according to the semester average of the student, and the ratio of students in each state is calculated in the long run. The results obtained are compared with the data from the 2015 cohort, which demonstrates the efficiency of the Markov chains model. For educational data mining, the classification technique is applied, and the decision tree algorithm is used to predict the academic performance of the students, generalizing results with an accuracy of 41.67%.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A learner model reflects learning patterns and characteristics of a learner. A learner model with learning history and its  effectiveness plays a significant role in supporting a learner’s understanding of their strengths and weaknesses of their way  of learning in order to make proper adjustments for improvement. Nowadays, learners have been engaging in online  learning frequently and intensely, leaving behind tremendous learning history data that contain informative insights about  the learners’ learning patterns. This paper proposed a method for developing learner models by applying the Markov chain  to learning history data. Our method transforms individual learners’ resource use data in a learning course into a large  amount of resource use sequences, then develops a Markov learner model, and generates the resource use steady state for  each learner. The resource use density, the resource steady state, and the assessment scores of individual learners tell their  learning patterns and the effectiveness of the learning patterns. From the Markov learner model, we generate a learner  profile for describing learning patterns and an index for measuring the strength of learning habits of the learner. We verified  our method by applying it to each course in the OULAD dataset to predict the learning performance using the index. The  preliminary results gain up to 97% accuracy on the pass/fail prediction problem.

Since mathematical skill learning can be considered as a process that moves through a set of states in a sequence of steps, we apply upon it basic results from finite Markov chain theory. Thus, we give a new approach to the measurement of skill learning abilities, and succeed in measuring the performance of groups of students during a mathematical skill task. Knowledge of this measure may be useful to the teacher of mathematics in helping his or her students to improve skill learning.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this paper we propose a model to study the appropriation of knowledge of one student in a non-collaborative online class. We formulate a stochastic model based on the quality of the teacher's class and the affinity of the student to understand the sessions, under the assumption that previous sessions have some influence in the understanding of the next sessions. This assumption implies that the process is not even a Markov process. This kind of situation appears in seminars and classes with many different sessions. We derive some recursive expressions for the distribution of the number of sessions that the student comprehends. Furthermore, we study the convergence of this distribution and study the speed of this convergence through some numerical examples.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Motivated by two survey data samples (student and teacher) obtained from institutional records in some school establishments of Mayotte, this paper has two main objectives. Firstly, a global application of statistical models for the analysis of students’ attitude toward mathematics (difficulty, interest or perception, value of the level in mathematics and others attitudes such as social factors, school environment) together with the teachers’ attitude toward mathematics (difficult courses, professional training experience, teaching preparation time, etc). Some didactic analysis have helped to reach conclusions to ensure the consistency of certain characterization. Secondly, we develop a theoretical methodology for parameter estimation of the density of the students’ level in mathematics and teachers’ attitude in the framework of stable and extreme values distributions which are suitable for studying non Gaussian and heavy-tailed distributions. More precisely, we described a new estimation method based on the tail regression estimation method for stable distributions. For the extreme family distributions, we consider a mixture estimation using the EM algorithm. Finaly, we end with a brief discussion on a current experimentation of the statistical and didactic analysis results in the form of Lesson study involving several teachers from the island of Mayotte.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Educational data mining (EDM) is an emerging interdisciplinary research area that deals with the development of methods to explore data originating in an educational context. EDM uses computational approaches to analyze educational data in order to study educational questions. This paper surveys the most relevant studies carried out in this field to date. First, it introduces EDM and describes the different groups of user, types of educational environments, and the data they provide. It then goes on to list the most typical/common tasks in the educational environment that have been resolved through data-mining techniques, and finally, some of the most promising future lines of research are discussed.

- [Stochastic Application of Absorbing Markov Chain to Secondary Schools: a Case Study of Monrovia Consolidated Schools System (Mcss), Monrovia-liberia.](https://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/155854)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Since the end of the prolonged civil war in Liberia in 2003, general enrolment in secondary schools has increased, a scenario that necessitates a signi cant amount of resources. Enrollment forecasting is a critical component of resource allocation budgeting and overall education sector growth planning. Education in primary and secondary schools receives a signi cant amount of public funding. It’s critical to keep track of Secondary School students’ overall development from enrollment to graduation in the three years allotted. The research was carried out in the Monrovia Consolidated School System (MCSS) to demonstrate the stochastic process of absorbing Markov Chain Techniques in studying the progress of students from class to class, to determine secondary completion and dropout rates, retention rates, and the expected duration of schooling by gender in the secondary schools of the Monrovia Consolidated School System (MCSS) from 2nd to 12th grades. The Markov Model concept has been widely utilized in single institutions of learning across the world, mostly in elementary and secondary schools, as well as universities and colleges, although there is no documented history of such use in Liberia. From 2017 to 2020, the target demographic was secondary enrolled students at the MCSS’s William V. S. Tubman, G.W. Gibson, and D-Twe high schools. Our ndings indicated that male students complete more classes than female students, and female dropout rates were greater at all levels when compared to male peers. Female students had a lower duration rate of schooling than their male counterparts, and the overall conclusion revealed that retention rates were lowest in 10th grade and greatest in 12th grade.

    	abstract = {Since the end of the prolonged civil war in Liberia in 2003, general enrolment in secondary
    schools has increased, a scenario that necessitates a signi cant amount of resources. Enrollment
    forecasting is a critical component of resource allocation budgeting and overall
    education sector growth planning. Education in primary and secondary schools receives
    a signi cant amount of public funding. It’s critical to keep track of Secondary School
    students’ overall development from enrollment to graduation in the three years allotted.
    The research was carried out in the Monrovia Consolidated School System ({MCSS})
    to demonstrate the stochastic process of absorbing Markov Chain Techniques in studying
    the progress of students from class to class, to determine secondary completion and
    dropout rates, retention rates, and the expected duration of schooling by gender in the
    secondary schools of the Monrovia Consolidated School System ({MCSS}) from 2nd to 12th
    grades.
    The Markov Model concept has been widely utilized in single institutions of learning
    across the world, mostly in elementary and secondary schools, as well as universities and
    colleges, although there is no documented history of such use in Liberia. From 2017 to
    2020, the target demographic was secondary enrolled students at the {MCSS}’s William V. S.
    Tubman, G.W. Gibson, and D-Twe high schools. Our  ndings indicated that male students
    complete more classes than female students, and female dropout rates were greater at
    all levels when compared to male peers. Female students had a lower duration rate of
    schooling than their male counterparts, and the overall conclusion revealed that retention
    rates were lowest in 10th grade and greatest in 12th grade.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Background: The students’ progression towards completing their higher education degrees possesses stochastic characteristics, and can therefore be modelled as an absorbing Markov chain. Such application would have a high practical value and offer great opportunities for implementation in practice. Objectives: The aim of the paper is to develop a stochastic model for estimation and continuous monitoring of various quality and effectiveness indicators of a given higher education study programme. Method: The study programme is modelled by a finite Markov chain with five transient and two absorbing states. The probability transition matrix is constructed. The quantitative characteristics of the absorbing Markov chain, like the expected time until absorption and the probabilities of absorption, are used to determine chosen indicators of the programme. Results: The model is applied to investigate the pattern of students’ enrolment and their academic performance in a Slovenian higher education institution. Based on the students’ intake records, the transition matrix was developed considering eight consecutive academic seasons from 2008/09 until 2016/17. The students’ progression towards the next stage of the study programme was estimated. The expected time that a student spends at a particular stage as well as the expected duration of the study is determined. The graduation and withdrawal probabilities were obtained. Besides, a prediction on the students’ enrolment for the next three academic years was made. The results were interpreted and discussed. Conclusion: The analysis presented is applicable for all higher education stakeholders. It is especially useful for a higher education institution’s managers seeing that it provides useful information to plan improvements regarding the quality and effectiveness of their study programmes to achieve better position in the educational market.

We use a Learning Assistant program to demonstrate the Markov model’s strength for assessing program efficacy. We find that Learning Assistants in gateway science courses are associated with a 9\% increase in the six-year graduation rate. These gains are larger for underrepresented minority (21\%) and first-generation students (18\%).

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The analysis of log data generated by online educational systems is an important task for improving the systems, and furthering our knowledge of how students learn. This paper uses previously unseen log data from Edulab, the largest provider of digital learning for mathematics in Denmark, to analyse the sessions of its users, where 1.08 million student sessions are extracted from a subset of their data. We propose to model students as a distribution of different underlying student behaviours, where the sequence of actions from each session belongs to an underlying student behaviour. We model student behaviour as Markov chains, such that a student is modelled as a distribution of Markov chains, which are estimated using a modified k-means clustering algorithm. The resulting Markov chains are readily interpretable, and in a qualitative analysis around 125,000 student sessions are identified as exhibiting unproductive student behaviour. Based on our results this student representation is promising, especially for educational systems offering many different learning usages, and offers an alternative to common approaches like modelling student behaviour as a single Markov chain often done in the literature.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Virtual reality-based instruction is becoming an important resource to improve learning outcomes and communicate hands-on skills in science laboratory courses. Our study attempts first to investigate whether a Markov chain model can predict the students’ performance in conducting an experiment and whether simulations improve learner achievement in handling lab equipment and conducting science experiments in physical labs. In the present study, three cohorts of graduate students are trained on a microscopy experiment using different teaching methodologies. The effectiveness of the teaching strategies is evaluated by observing the sequences of students’ actions, while engaging in the microscopy experiment in real-lab situations. The students’ ability in performing the science experiment is estimated by sequential analysis using a Markov chain model. According to the Markov chain analysis, the students who are trained via a virtual reality software exhibit a higher probability to perform the steps of the experiment without difficulty and without assistance than their fellow students who attend more traditional training scenarios. Our study indicates that a Markov chain model is a powerful tool that can lead to a dynamic evaluation of the students’ performance in science experiments by tracing the students’ knowledge states and by predicting their innate abilities.

    The ability to predict student performance in a course or program creates opportunities to improve educational outcomes. With effective performance prediction approaches, instructors can allocate resources and instruction more accurately. Research in this area seeks to identify features that can be used to make predictions, to identify algorithms that can improve predictions, and to quantify aspects of student performance. Moreover, research in predicting student performance seeks to determine interrelated features and to identify the underlying reasons why certain features work better than others. This working group report presents a systematic literature review of work in the area of predicting student performance. Our analysis shows a clearly increasing amount of research in this area, as well as an increasing variety of techniques used. At the same time, the review uncovered a number of issues with research quality that drives a need for the community to provide more detailed reporting of methods and results and to increase efforts to validate and replicate work.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) is a commonly used approach for student modeling, and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a versatile model that can be applied to a wide range of tasks, such as language translation. In this work, we directly compared three models: BKT, its variant Intervention-BKT (IBKT), and LSTM, on two types of student modeling tasks: post-test scores prediction and learning gains prediction. Additionally, while previous work on student learning has often used skill/knowledge components identified by domain experts, we incorporated an automatic skill discovery method (SK), which includes a nonparametric prior over the exercise-skill assignments, to all three models. Thus, we explored a total of six models: BKT, BKT+SK, IBKT, IBKT+SK, LSTM, and LSTM+SK. Two training datasets were employed, one was collected from a natural language physics intelligent tutoring system named Cordillera, and the other was from a standard probability intelligent tutoring system named Pyrenees. Overall, our results showed that BKT and BKT+SK outperformed the others on predicting post-test scores, whereas LSTM and LSTM+SK achieved the highest accuracy, F1-measure, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) on predicting learning gains. Furthermore, we demonstrated that by combining SK with the BKT model, BKT+SK could reliably predict post-test scores using only the earliest 50% of the entire training sequences. For learning gain early prediction, using the earliest 70% of the entire sequences, LSTM can deliver a comparable prediction as using the entire training sequences. The findings yield a learning environment that can foretell students’ performance and learning gains early, and can render adaptive pedagogical strategy accordingly.

- [`(Not exist)` Deep Knowledge Tracing](https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/bio/papers/deepKnowledgeTracing.pdf)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Knowledge tracing—where a machine models the knowledge of a student as they interact with coursework—is a well established problem in computer supported education. Though effectively modeling student knowledge would have high educational impact, the task has many inherent challenges. In this paper we explore the utility of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model student learning. The RNN family of models have important advantages over previous methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge. Using neural networks results in substantial improvements in prediction performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned model can be used for intelligent curriculum design and allows straightforward interpretation and discovery of structure in student tasks. These results suggest a promising new line of research for knowledge tracing and an exemplary application task for RNNs

- [How Deep is Knowledge Tracing? ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02416)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
      In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning approach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of exercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or DKT---has demonstrated a stunning performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge tracing or BKT. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for DKT's advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that DKT can leverage but which BKT cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity that BKT fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence, inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate that when BKT is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical regularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---BKT achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of DKT. We argue that while DKT is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel representations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not require `depth'; shallow models like BKT can perform just as well and offer us greater interpretability and explanatory power.

    	abstract = {In theoretical cognitive science, there is a tension between highly structured models whose parameters have a direct psychological interpretation and highly complex, general-purpose models whose parameters and representations are difficult to interpret. The former typically provide more insight into cognition but the latter often perform better. This tension has recently surfaced in the realm of educational data mining, where a deep learning approach to predicting students' performance as they work through a series of exercises---termed deep knowledge tracing or {DKT}---has demonstrated a stunning performance advantage over the mainstay of the field, Bayesian knowledge tracing or {BKT}. In this article, we attempt to understand the basis for {DKT}'s advantage by considering the sources of statistical regularity in the data that {DKT} can leverage but which {BKT} cannot. We hypothesize four forms of regularity that {BKT} fails to exploit: recency effects, the contextualized trial sequence, inter-skill similarity, and individual variation in ability. We demonstrate that when {BKT} is extended to allow it more flexibility in modeling statistical regularities---using extensions previously proposed in the literature---{BKT} achieves a level of performance indistinguishable from that of {DKT}. We argue that while {DKT} is a powerful, useful, general-purpose framework for modeling student learning, its gains do not come from the discovery of novel representations---the fundamental advantage of deep learning. To answer the question posed in our title, knowledge tracing may be a domain that does not require `depth'; shallow models like {BKT} can perform just as well and offer us greater interpretability and explanatory power.},

- [`(Not exist)` Deep learning for knowledge tracing in learning analytics: an overview](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/541259322.pdf)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Learning Analytics (LA) is a recent research branch that refers to methods for measuring, collecting, analyzing, and reporting learners’ data, in order to better understand and optimize the processes and the environments. Knowledge Tracing (KT) deals with the modeling of the evolution, during the time, of the students’ learning process. Particularly its aim is to predict students’ outcomes in order to avoid failures and to support both students and teachers. Recently, KT has been tackled by exploiting Deep Learning (DL) models and generating a new, ongoing, research line that is known as Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). This was made possible by the digitalization process that has simplified the gathering of educational data from many different sources such as online learning platforms, intelligent objects, and mainstream IT-based systems for education. DKT predicts the student’s performances by using the information embedded in the collected data. Moreover, it has been shown to be able to outperform the state-of-the-art models for KT. In this paper, we briefly describe the most promising DL models, by focusing on their prominent contribution in solving the KT task.

- [A Bayesian-based knowledge tracing model for improving safety training outcomes in construction: An adaptive learning framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616592200045X?via%3Dihub)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Safety training plays a pivotal role in effectively reducing unsafe behaviors in the construction industry. Despite the numerous effort to improve safety training, existing studies lacked consideration of trainees' different learning characters, nor did they adapt the suitable training materials to trainees' mastery of safety knowledge. Against this contextual backdrop, this research proposes a Bayesian-based Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model to recommend personalized training materials according to trainees's learning progress. The proposed BKT model tracks and predicts trainees' performance with their cognitive characters, abilities, and historical training records. It also adjusts trainee's probability of mastering safety knowledge concepts for determining future training sessions. In this way, the safety training is adaptive and personalized, thus more effective. An exploration study is conducted in the laboratory environment to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed BKT model. The research results showed that 83.33% of the respondents felt gained safety knowledge after the training, and 66.67% of the respondents affirmed the effectiveness of the BKT model-based training system in improving the effectiveness of training. The results demonstrated that the proposed model performed well at educating safety knowledge and reducing unsafe behavior.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Research on intelligent tutoring seeks to develop systems for automating education and to explore epistemological issues concerning the nature of the knowledge presented by tutors and how that knowledge can be learned. The ACT theory of skill acquisition and its successor (PUPS--PenUltimate Production System) provides production-system models of the acquisition of skills such as LISP programming, geometry theorem-proving, and solving of algebraic equations. The three major sections of the document discuss; (l) the cognitive theory that serves as the basis for the tutoring endeavors, (2) the model-tracing methodology and how it derives from the cognitive theory, and (3) issues that arise in implementing the methodology. Knowledge begins in declarative form and is used by analogical processes to solve specific problems. Domain-specific productions are compiled from the traces of these problem solutions. The model-tracing methodology has been developed as a means of displaying this cognitive theory in intelligent tutoring. Implementation of the methodology involves developing a student model, a pedagogical module, and an interface. Work on tutoring and on skill acquisition have proven to be symbiotic -- each has furthered the other's development. (Author/MNS)

- [`(Not exist)` Learning for Mastery](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED053419.pdf)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Most students, perhaps over 90 percent, can master what teachers have to teach them, and it is the task of instruction to find the means which will enable students to master the subject under consideration. A basic task is to determine what is meant by mastery of the subject and to search for methods and materials which will enable the largest proportion of students to attain such mastery. That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper describes a novel method to create a quantitative model of an educational content domain of related practice item-types using learning curves. By using a pairwise test to search for the relationships between learning curves for these item-types, we show how the test results in a set of pairwise transfer relationships that can be expressed in a Q-matrix domain model. Creating these Q-matrices for various test criteria we show that the new domain model results in consistently better learning curve fits as shown by cross-validation. Further, the Q-matrices produced can be used by educators or curriculum designers to gain a richer, more integrated perspective on concepts in the domain. The model may also have implications for tracing student knowledge more effectively to sequence practice in tutoring/training software. (Contains 2 figures.)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This article is a review of experiments comparing the effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no tutoring. “No tutoring” refers to instruction that teaches the same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases. In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems was 0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Traditionally, Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) has focused on instructional methods to decrease extraneous cognitive load so that available cognitive resources can be fully devoted to learning. This article strengthens the cognitive base of CLT by linking cognitive processes to the processes used by biological evolution. The article discusses recent developments in CLT related to the current view in instructional design that real-life tasks should be the driving force for complex learning. First, the complexity, or intrinsic cognitive load, of such tasks is often high so that new methods are needed to manage cognitive load. Second, complex learning is a lengthy process requiring learners’ motivational states and levels of expertise development to be taken into account. Third, this perspective requires more advanced methods to measure expertise and cognitive load so that instruction can be flexibly adapted to individual learners’ needs. Experimental studies are reviewed to illustrate these recent developments. Guidelines for future research are provided.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    A lognormal model for the response times of a person on a set of test items is investigated. The model has a parameter structure analogous to the two-parameter logistic response models in item response theory, with a parameter for the speed of each person as well as parameters for the time intensity and discriminating power of each item. It is shown how these parameters can be estimated by a Markov chain Monte Carlo method (Gibbs sampler). The method was used to analyze response times for the adaptive version of a test from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery. The same data set was used to test the validity of the model against a normal model using posterior predictive checks on the response times. The lognormal model showed an excellent fit to the data, whereas the normal model seemed unable to allow for a characteristic skewness of the response time distributions. The addition of an equality constraint on the discrimination parameters led only to a slight loss of fit. The potential use of the model for improving the daily practice of testing is indicated.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Current modeling of response times on test items has been strongly influenced by the paradigm of experimental reaction-time research in psychology. For instance, some of the models have a parameter structure that was chosen to represent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, while others equate speed directly with response time. Also, several response-time models seem to be unclear as to the level of parametrization they represent. A hierarchical framework for modeling speed and accuracy on test items is presented as an alternative to these models. The framework allows a “plug-and-play approach” with alternative choices of models for the response and response-time distributions as well as the distributions of their parameters. Bayesian treatment of the framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation facilitates the approach. Use of the framework is illustrated for the choice of a normal-ogive response model, a lognormal model for the response times, and multivariate normal models for their parameters with Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior distribution.

- [Joint modeling of ability and differential speed using responses and response times ](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00273171.2016.1171128)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    With computerized testing, it is possible to record both the responses of test takers to test questions (i.e., items) and the amount of time spent by a test taker in responding to each question. Various models have been proposed that take into account both test-taker ability and working speed, with the many models assuming a constant working speed throughout the test. The constant working speed assumption may be inappropriate for various reasons. For example, a test taker may need to adjust the pace due to time mismanagement, or a test taker who started out working too fast may reduce the working speed to improve accuracy. A model is proposed here that allows for variable working speed. An illustration of the model using the Amsterdam Chess Test data is provided.

    	abstract = {Current modeling of response times on test items has been strongly influenced by the paradigm of experimental reaction-time research in psychology. For instance, some of the models have a parameter structure that was chosen to represent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, while others equate speed directly with response time. Also, several response-time models seem to be unclear as to the level of parametrization they represent. A hierarchical framework for modeling speed and accuracy on test items is presented as an alternative to these models. The framework allows a “plug-and-play approach” with alternative choices of models for the response and response-time distributions as well as the distributions of their parameters. Bayesian treatment of the framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation facilitates the approach. Use of the framework is illustrated for the choice of a normal-ogive response model, a lognormal model for the response times, and multivariate normal models for their parameters with Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior distribution.},

    This edited volume gives a new and integrated introduction to item re­ sponse models (predominantly used in measurement applications in psy­ chology, education, and other social science areas) from the viewpoint of the statistical theory of generalized linear and nonlinear mixed models. Moreover, this new framework aHows the domain of item response mod­ els to be co-ordinated and broadened to emphasize their explanatory uses beyond their standard descriptive uses. The basic explanatory principle is that item responses can be modeled as a function of predictors of various kinds. The predictors can be (a) char­ acteristics of items, of persons, and of combinations of persons and items; they can be (b) observed or latent (of either items or persons); and they can be (c) latent continuous or latent categorical. Thus, a broad range of models can be generated, including a wide range of extant item response models as weH as some new ones. Within this range, models with explana­ tory predictors are given special attention, but we also discuss descriptive models. Note that the 'item responses' that we are referring to are not just the traditional 'test data,' but are broadly conceived as categorical data from a repeated observations design. Hence, data from studies with repeated-observations experimental designs, or with longitudinal designs, mayaIso be modeled. The intended audience for this volume is rather broad.

- [`(Not exist)` Adaptive Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Based on Personalized Characteristics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10761945)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model is a student knowledge state model that currently widely used in intelligent teaching system. However, BKT still has limitations in capturing dynamic changes during the student learning process and handling multiple characteristics as well as individualized needs. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an adaptive BKT model based on students' personalized features. The core of the model lies in constructing a feature set based on students' previous personalized question-answering data, and dynamically classifying students' current learning situation accordingly. The dynamic classification method classifies students by analyzing their question-answering performance in real time and adjusts the BKT parameters accordingly to more accurately reflect their current knowledge status. On this basis, it predicts students' future learning status and question-answering performance. Comparative experiments show that the model can better adapt to individual learning differences and significantly improve the accuracy of predicting students' future question-answering correctness.

    This article describes the application of a dynamic, or process assessment, model for children with reading problems. The purpose of the investigation was to evaluate individual differences in the number of learning trials needed by 36 children (mean age = 7.2) to reach criterion on training words during phonics instruction on two short vowels. Furthermore, the study investigated the extent to which such a process measure of learning rate during training was related to learning outcomes or products (i.e., retention and posttest performance).

- [Structuring the Transition From Example Study to Problem Solving in Cognitive Skill Acquisition: A Cognitive Load Perspective](https://mrbartonmaths.com/resourcesnew/8.%20Research/Explicit%20Instruction/Structuring%20the%20Transition%20From%20Example%20Study%20to%20Problem%20Solving.pdf)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Cognitive load research has shown that learning from worked-out examples, in comparison to problem solving, is very effective during the initial stages of cognitive skill acquisition. In later stages, however, solving problems is superior. In this contribution, theoretical analyses of different types of cognitive load and their changes over the stages of skill acquisition are presented. Two basic arguments are put forth: (a) Intrinsic cognitive load gradually decreases so that a gradual increase of problem-solving demands is possible without inducing cognitive overload. (b) In contrast to the earlier stages, different learner activities during the later stages constitute either germane or extraneous load, because different instructional goals are to be achieved. Based on these analyses, we propose a fading procedure in which problem-solving elements are successively integrated into example study until the learners are expected to solve problems on their own. Empirical evidence supporting this fading procedure is provided, and future research is proposed that focuses on how to ensure that the fading procedure is adaptive to the learners’ prior knowledge levels.

- [The Use of Worked Examples as a Substitute for Problem Solving in Learning Algebra](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The knowledge required to solve algebra manipulation problems and procedures designed to hasten knowledge acquisition were studied in a series of five experiments. It was hypothesized that, as occurs in other domains, algebra problem-solving skill requires a large number of schemas and that schema acquisition is retarded by conventional problem-solving search techniques. Experiment 1, using Year 9, Year 11, and university mathematics students, found that the more experienced students had a better cognitive representation of algebraic equations than less experienced students as measured by their ability to (a) recall equations, and (b) distinguish between perceptually similar equations on the basis of solution mode. Experiments 2 through 5 studied the use of worked examples as a means of facilitating the acquisition of knowledge needed for effective problem solving. It was found that not only did worked examples, as expected, require considerably less time to process than conventional problems, but that subsequent problems similar to the initial ones also were solved more rapidly. Furthermore, decreased solution time was accompanied by a decrease in the number of mathematical errors. Both of these findings were specific to problems identical in structure to the initial ones. It was concluded that for novice problem solvers, general algebra rules are reflected in only a limited number of schemas. Abstraction of general rules from schemas may occur only with considerable practice and exposure to a wider range of schemas.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    To better understand the self-regulated learning process in online learning environments, this research applied a data mining method, the two-layer hidden Markov model (TL-HMM), to explore the patterns of learning activities. We analyzed 25,818 entries of behavior log data from an intelligent tutoring system. Results indicated that students with different learning outcomes demonstrated distinct learning patterns. Students who failed a problem set exhibited more passive learning behaviors and could hardly learn from practice, while students who mastered a problem set could effectively regulate their learning. Furthermore, we extended the use of TL-HMM to predicting learning outcome from behavior sequences and checked through cross-validation. TL-HMM is demonstrated helpful to gain insight into learners’ interactions with online learning environments. In practice, TL-HMM could be embedded in intelligent tutoring systems to monitor learning behaviors and learner status, so as to detect the difficulties of learners and facilitate learning.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    With the onset of online education via technology-enhanced learning platforms, large amount of educational data is being generated in the form of logs, clickstreams, performance, etc. These Virtual Learning Environments provide an opportunity to the researchers for the application of educational data mining and learning analytics, for mining the students learning behavior. This further helps them in data-driven decision making through timely intervention via early warning systems (EWS), reflecting and optimizing educational environments, and refining pedagogical designs. In this, the role of EWS is to timely identify the at-risk students. This study proposes a modeling methodology deploying interpretable Hidden Markov Model for mining of the sequential learning behavior built upon derived performance features from light-weight assessments. The public OULA dataset having diversified courses and 32 593 student records is used for validation. The results on the unseen test data achieve a classification accuracy ranging from 87.67% to 94.83% and AUC from 0.927 to 0.989, and outperforms other baseline models. For implementation of EWS, the study also predicts the optimal time-period, during the first and second quarter of the course with sufficient number of light-weight assessments in place. With the outcomes, this study tries to establish an efficient generalized modeling framework that may lead the higher educational institutes toward sustainable development.

- [The effect of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) on student achievement in Agebraic expression](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/59807)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this experimental study, use of Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) followed by use of an Intelligent Tutoring System (CAI+ITS) was compared to the use of CAI (CAI only) in tutoring students on the topic of Algebraic Expression. Two groups of students participated in the study. One group of 32 students studied algebraic expression in a CAI learning environment, while the other group of 30 students was in a CAI and ITS (CAI+ITS) environment. Before the experimental treatment began, subjects were given a pre-test on algebraic expression. A posttest was also given at the end of the study. The experimental treatment was administered in eight sessions with one hour per session. For the first stage of the study, both groups of subjects studied algebraic expression in a CAI environment. In the second stage, subjects from the CAI group continued with a tutoring session using the drill and practice section of the CAI package, whereas subjects from the CAI+ITS environment continued their learning using the ITS tutorial. The results of the study showed that there was a significant difference in the students’ achievement in algebraic expression between students who learned with CAI+ITS and who learned with CAI only as the delivery system. The findings of the study indicated that CAI+ITS was more effective in helping students learn algebraic expression as compared to using CAI alone. This study suggests that educators and software developers should focus on the development of ITS based learning tools or integrate ITS elements in courseware development rather than developing a mere CAI tool.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Time-on-task effects on response accuracy in digital reading tasks were examined using PISA 2009 data (N = 34,062, 19 countries/economies). As a baseline, task responses were explained by time on task, tasks' easiness, and persons' digital reading skill (Model 1). Model 2 added a quadratic time-on-task effect, persons' comprehension skill and tasks' navigation demands as predictors. In each country, linear and quadratic time-on-task effects were moderated by person and task characteristics. Strongly positive linear time-on-task effects were found for persons being poor digital readers (Model 1) and poor comprehenders (Model 2), which decreased with increasing skill. Positive linear time-on-task effects were found for hard tasks (Model 1) and tasks high in navigation demands (Model 2). For easy tasks and tasks low in navigation demands, the time-on-task effects were negative, or close to zero, respectively. A negative quadratic component of the time-on-task effect was more pronounced for strong comprehenders, while the linear component was weaker. Correspondingly, for tasks high in navigation demands the negative quadratic component to the time-on-task effect was weaker, and the linear component was stronger. These results are in line with a dual-processing account of digital reading that distinguishes automatic reading components from resource-demanding regulation and navigation processes.

- [`(Not exist)` Mathematics Achievement Effects of Three Levels of Individualization: Whole Class, Ability Grouped, and Individualized Instruction](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED242559.pdf)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This research evaluated mathematics achievement and attitudinal effects of three instructional methods directed in varying degrees toward accommodating diversity in students' prior achievement. Two randomized field experiments of 16 and 18 weeks' duration, respectively, compared an individualized model, Team Assisted Individualization (TAI); an ability grouped model, Ability Grouped Active Teaching (AGAT); a group-paced model, the Missouri Mathematics Program (MMP); and, in Experiment 2 only, untreated control classes. The first experiment involved pupils in grades 4-6, while the second experiment was conducted with pupils in grades 3-5. Nested analysis of variance on CTBS Computations scores adjusted for pretests indicated that in both experiments, TAI and AGAT exceeded MMP. In Experiment 2, TAI, AGAT, and MMP also exceeded control. No interactions with prior achievement were found. Effects on Liking of Math Class and (in Experiment 1) Self-Concept in Math favored TAI. (Author/MNS)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Panel estimation techniques are utilized to estimate econometric models of the determinants of mathematics achievement for a nationally representative sample of US high school students from the National Education Longitudinal Studies program (NELS88). Among the results, several relate to variables discussed as potentially important policy variables. Extra time spent on mathematics homework increases student test scores while extra hours per day of watching television negatively impacts math test scores. The results of the estimations also indicate the positive and significant effect of an increase in the number of minutes of each class period for mathematics. Given the means and standard deviations of these variables, 3 hours per week for math homework, 2.6 hours per day of watching TV, 52 minutes per math class period, as well as the relatively large effects associated with these variables, the potential for manipulating them to enhance math achievement seems like a real possibility.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Information and communication technologies hold much promise for use in education in developing countries. This study reports on an evaluation conducted on the introduction of computers in the delivery of the mathematics curriculum in one of the provinces of South Africa. Although the request was for an outcome evaluation very early in the implementation of the program, it was tailored in such a way as to fulfill a more formative role. Despite substantial variability in implementation, and in most cases with very weak exposure of the learners to the intervention, sufficient evidence emerged to indicate that this mode of curriculum delivery may be effective. Improvement in mathematics performance was related to a range of variables: some concerned classroom teaching practices, some referred to social differences between the learners, and some to the specific intervention. The strongest of these predictors in the sample was the strength of the intervention: the more time learners spent on using the software to study mathematics, the more improvement they showed from 1 year to the next in their performance in the subject.

    Declining mathematics scores are forcing school administrators to look for nontraditional ways to educate students. Adaptive learning systems have been implemented in schools with the purpose of providing personalized learning opportunities for students. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate the effect of adaptive supplemental lessons on elementary students’ achievement in mathematics. This study was conducted in a large, urban school district. This study utilized a quasi-experimental research design with a sample size of 7,114 students in Grades 3–6 in the control group (2015–2016 school year) and 7,733 students in Grades 3–6 in the treatment group (2016–2017 school year). The treatment group received supplemental adaptive mathematics lessons within their regular mathematics block. The adaptive learning system used was LGL Math Edge. This study also included analysis of the effects of adaptive learning on various subgroups, as well as the relationship between time spent in LGL Math Edge and mathematics achievement from pretest to posttest. Secondary data were used to compare the mean gain score of the adaptive, diagnostic mathematics assessment (ADAM) pretest and posttest between the control and treatment groups. The results of this study showed that there was a statistically significant difference in student achievement when students received the treatment of adaptive learning. This was true for all subgroups examined. The results of this study also showed there was a statistically significant relationship between the amount of time students spend in LGL Math Edge and mathematics achievement on ADAM. The findings thus revealed that using supplemental adaptive lessons in addition to conventional instruction improved student achievement in mathematics. PRE

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this paper we introduce new tools for measuring and visualizing the learning process of students in large classes where students are required to use a computer-supported problem solving learning environment (PSLE) either in class or as homework. These learning environments give students unlimited opportunities to propose a solution to the problem and give them immediate feedback. We show how to create a graphical representation, the Problem Solving Markov Model (PSMM), of the set of all attempted solutions proposed by the class. Each node in the PSMM consists of an equivalence class of attempted solutions and each edge corresponds to a transition from one attempted solution to another in one step. The edges are typically labeled with the number of times a students went directly from one attempted solution to the next, or with the probability of going between the two nodes. We give examples from two tools: CalcTutor for Calculus problems, and Spinoza for Java or Python programming, and we provide several pedagogical applications of PSMMs which give the instructor a simple way to obtain a highly nuanced understanding of mastery of the problem solving process for individual students and for the class as a whole.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The learning process depends on the nature of the learning environment, particularly in the case of open-ended learning environments, where the learning process is considered to be non-linear. In this paper, we report on the findings of employing a multimodal Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based methodology to investigate the temporal learning processes of two types of learners that have learning gains and a type that does not have learning gains in an open-ended collaborative learning activity. Considering log data, speech behavior, affective states and gaze patterns, we find that all learners start from a similar state of non-productivity, but once out of it they are unlikely to fall back into that state, especially in the case of the learners that have learning gains. Those who have learning gains shift between two problem solving strategies, each characterized by both exploratory and reflective actions, as well as demonstrate speech and gaze patterns associated with these strategies, that differ from those who don't have learning gains. Further, the teams that have learning gains also differ between themselves in the manner in which they employ the problem solving strategies over the interaction, as well as in the manner they express negative emotions while exhibiting a particular strategy. These outcomes contribute to understanding the multiple pathways of learning in an open-ended collaborative learning environment, and provide actionable insights for designing effective interventions.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    While a rich methodology for analyzing response patterns for accuracy and time-on-task is at hand via Item Response Theory (IRT), tests with time cutoffs are so far harder to handle. Given that this test mode is widely applied, especially in the context of paper-and-pencil testing, there is a lack of psychometric techniques for a relevant number of tests. In this context, the original work of Rasch and his Rasch Poisson Counts model indeed offers an approach for this scenario that is adequate to solve the problem but which leads to model violations in many cases. Recent developments in statistical modeling – the so-called Conway Maxwell Poisson Counts Model (CMPCM) – can solve the problem of under- and overdispersion. We apply this model to the norm data of the ELFE II reading comprehension test and analyze patterns of over- and underdispersion with regard to speededness and mode effects. CMPCM with subtest-specific dispersion was adequate to model the raw test data, with underdispersion occurring mainly in highly speeded subtests with low difficulty and overdispersion in less speeded subtests with high difficulty. Thus, the CMPCM could contribute to psychometric methodology to appropriately model tests with time cutoffs on the subtest level.

- [Exploring the Relation between Time on Task and Ability in Complex Problem Solving](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289614001445?via%3Dihub)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Complex problem solving (CPS) as an individual skill has gained importance in educational and psychological research, since it requires skills beyond routine reasoning, assessed by computer-based means. However, most of the CPS research has been concerned with the validity of CPS assessments based on students’ responses (i.e., their CPS ability) rather than their response times (i.e., CPS time on task). Therefore, the present investigation was aimed at examining the empirical relation between CPS time on task and CPS ability. On the basis of the data obtained from a representative sample of N = 2,000 Finnish ninth graders, we specified Bayesian response time and structural equation models in order to study the relations between CPS time on task, CPS ability, cognitive and motivational constructs as well as school achievement. Our results suggest that (a) Long time on task in CPS and CPS ability are positively related (ρ = .40); (b) reasoning and students’ performance and mastery orientations have differential effects on CPS time on task (βREASON = .25, βPER-GOALS = − .06, βMAST-GOALS = .13) and CPS ability (βREASON = .54, βPER-GOALS = .03, βMAST-GOALS = .03); and (c) CPS time on task predicts school achievement (β = .12–.22), but does not explain variance beyond CPS ability. We conclude that CPS time on task provides a more differentiated perspective on CPS performance, yielding implications for research on and the assessment of CPS.

- [Controlling Individuals’ Time Spent on Task in Speeded Performance Measures: Experimental Time Limits, Posterior Time Limits, and Response Time Modeling](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146621613517164)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The speed-ability trade-off becomes a measurement problem if there is between-subject variation in the speed-ability compromise, as this may affect the comparability of ability estimates. To control individual speed differences, the response-signal (RS) paradigm was applied requiring an immediate response as soon as an acoustic signal is presented. A figural discrimination task and a word recognition task were completed both in an untimed condition allowing individual differences in time spent on task and in several timed conditions where the time available for item completion was limited using the RS paradigm. Thus, speed was manipulated by varying the available time between stimulus-onset and RS. A total of N = 205 high school students participated in the study. Results showed that across timed conditions with decreasing time on task, the ability level and ability variance decreased substantially. Ability correlations between timed conditions were high, whereas correlations between untimed and timed conditions were low. This finding suggested that ability differences being inconsistent to those found in the timed condition are due to individual differences in time on task in the untimed condition. To eliminate these differences, two ways were considered. First, untimed responses were recoded using two-tailed posterior time limits. As expected, correlations between timed and untimed conditions were increased. Second, the log-transformed item response times were included in the item response model, which led to even higher correlations between timed and untimed conditions. Validity and generalizability of the proposed testing procedure are discussed.

    The ACT Programming Tutor helps students as they complete short programming exercises. The tutor is constructed around an ideal student model consisting of several hundred production rules. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and serves as an overlay model of the student’s knowledge. As the student completes exercises, the tutor maintains an estimate of the probability that student has learned each rule, based on a two-state learning model. These estimates are employed to guide remediation. This paper assesses the predictive validity of this modeling process, and examines the implications for the rules in the ideal student model.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In order to personalize the assessment services, the assessment systems need to build suitable student models for heterogeneous student populations. The present study focuses on efficiently modeling students according to their time-varying behavior during web-based self-assessment, enriching the models with a notion of dynamics. The suggested approach forms and revises the student models on-the-fly, using three popular stream mining classification techniques. All methods use specific time-based features as predictors, and the students' self-assessment achievement levels as target values. The obtained results demonstrate that level of certainty, effort and time-spent on answering correctly/wrongly could contribute to pursuing fine-grained and robust student models during self-assessment.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper examines the role of adaptive student modeling in cognitive tutor research and dissemination. Cognitive tutorsTM are problem solving environments constructed around cognitive models of the knowledge students are acquiring. Over the past decade we in the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor (PACT) Center at Carnegie Mellon have been employing a cognitive programming tutor in university-based teaching and research, while simultaneously developing cognitive mathematics tutors that are currently in use in about 150 schools in 14 states. This paper examines adaptive student modeling issues in these two contexts. We examine the role of student modeling in making the transition from the research lab to widespread classroom use, describe our university-based efforts to empirically validate student modeling in the ACT Programming Tutor, and conclude with a description of the key role that student modeling plays in formative evaluations of the Cognitive Algebra II Tutor.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This study examines whether My Math Academy, a digital gamebased learning environment that provides personalized content and adaptive embedded assessments, can improve math knowledge of Transitional Kindergarten and Kindergarten students. A cluster randomized study was conducted with 20 classrooms, 10 of which were randomly assigned to use My Math Academy for 12–14 weeks. Results of hierarchical linear models indicated that after using the app for about 5 hours, treatment students significantly outperformed the control group in math knowledge and skills as measured by TEMA-3. My Math Academy produced the greatest learning gains in students who began with a moderate level of math knowledge and on the most difficult skills assessed. Additionally, the more games students played, the greater the learning gains they experienced. Teacher surveys revealed that My Math Academy produced positive impacts on students’ interest and self-confidence in learning math. Teachers also recognized My Math Academy as a user-friendly, valuable learning resource that they will continue to use. The study results will inform ongoing development of My Math Academy, including tools to enable teachers to help children with low levels of prior math knowledge.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The use of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) is growing rapidly in the field of education. In mathematics, adaptive and personalized scenarios mediated by these systems have been implemented to aid concept comprehension and skill development. This study presents a systematic review on the current status of the use of ITSs in mathematics education in higher education institutions (HEI). More specifically, it inquires about elements rarely addressed in reviews, such as the purposes, advantages, effectiveness, limitations, characteristics, and development and research methodologies in ITSs used for mathematics education. We analyzed 43 documents in 15 specialized and indexed journals in the years 2012-2022. In addition to providing a global overview of the implementation of ITSs in mathematics teaching and learning, we also present trends and opportunities for future research on building educational environments guided by these technologies.that promote SRL to decrease math anxiety and improve student performance.

- [A student modeling method combining Deep Learning and forgetting models with Knowledge Tracing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050923012656?via%3Dihub)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Educational Data Mining (EDM) aims to enhance education by analyzing learners’ skills and question difficulty levels using machine learning methods. Knowledge Tracing (KT), a subfield of EDM, utilizes Hidden Markov Models to estimate learners’ abilities and predict their performance on unseen questions. While deep learning methods, such as bi-directional RNNs, have improved KT's accuracy, they may lack interpretability from an educational psychology perspective. Item Response Theory (IRT), widely used in educational statistics, offers greater explanatory potential. This study proposes a model that integrates the concept of forgetting into IRT for improved accuracy and explainability in Knowledge Tracing using bi-directional RNNs. The forgetting concept is based on Ebbinghaus’ forgetting curve theory. Three experiments were conducted using synthetic data to compare a model from a previous study, a model based on the proposed method, and a model that combines the previous study's model with IRT but excludes the forgetting concept.

- [The role of time on task in computer-based low-stakes assessment of cross-curricular skills](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/a0035507)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The role of time on task (TOT) for students’ attainment in a low-stakes assessment of cross-curricular skills was examined using the log data collected in the computer-based assessment (CBA). Two structural equation models were compared: Model 1, in which students’ test scores were explained by grade point average (GPA) together with mastery and detrimental motivational attitudes, and Model 2, in which TOT was added to the model to mediate the effects of GPA and the 2 motivational constructs. Fitting the models to nationally representative data of 4,249 Finnish 9th graders (Mage = 15.92 years) confirmed the hypothesis that investment of time plays a key role in explaining test scores in low-stakes assessment even when prior ability (GPA) is taken into account. It was also confirmed that the effects of the detrimental attitudes on students’ attainment were mediated by TOT. The study makes an important contribution to research regarding the role of motivational attitudes and TOT in low-stakes assessment, which is vital for the use of the assessment results in national and international benchmarking. It is concluded that log data provide a functional way to investigate time investment in CBA as an indicator for students’ effort, yielding relevant implications for educational psychologists.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The dissertation *"Evaluation of an Approach to Intelligent Coaching with Student Modeling"* by Anoosh Khatib Shahidi (Ph.D., University of Pittsburgh, 1993) examines the effectiveness of student modeling in intelligent coaching systems by comparing three approaches: an intelligent coaching system with student modeling (providing tailored feedback by diagnosing knowledge gaps and misconceptions), a rudimentary coaching system without student modeling (offering only correctness feedback), and a passive on-line help system. The results demonstrated that students using the intelligent coaching system achieved significantly higher post-test completion rates with fewer errors, with anaphoric references (feedback linking past actions to current mistakes) proving particularly impactful. The study also extended Goldstein’s (1982) genetic graph formalism to support bidirectional learning (both general-to-specific and specific-to-general knowledge progression). Despite the higher development costs associated with intelligent systems, the findings underscore their educational value in procedural domains like spreadsheet programming, offering insights for designing adaptive instructional systems that leverage student modeling for more effective learning.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Competency-Based Education (CBE) is proposed as a model that can solve some of higher education’s current challenges including the one size fits all approach to student learning. CBE targets this issue by focusing on a student autonomy and personalized learning approaches; however, successful implementation of this requires students have a level of self-regulation skills they often do not have thereby necessitating supports such as implementing educational technologies. This study explored the impact of an Open Social Student Model (OSSM) tool on the self-regulation of students in a competency-based undergraduate technology course. In particular, the study looked at the extent to which the OSSM tool encouraged students to engage in social comparison and self-regulation as measured by course progression and student choice of content completed. Furthermore, additional factors such as gender identity, social comparison orientation and motivation orientation were included because of their influence on the social comparison process and potential moderating effects on the impact of the tool. The study utilized a quasi-experimental between-groups design to compare course progress, content selection and impact of the moderating variables across treatment groups. Results indicated no significant impact on any of the aforementioned areas. While the study may indicate some evidence for the lack of efficacy OSSM tools have in CBE environments the results conflict with a significant amount of literature and indicate that the tool may have been ignored by students or failed to provide desirable comparisons to engage with. Guidelines for improving educational technology integration and therefore utilization based on current literature are covered for future researchers, along with suggestions for modifying OSSM design to improve student comparison opportunities and utilization of the OSSM

- [Hybrid Models for Knowledge Tracing: A Systematic Literature Review](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10379123)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Knowledge tracing is a well-known problem in AI for education, consisting of monitoring how the knowledge state of students changes during the learning process and accurately predicting their performance in future exercises. In recent years, many advances have been made thanks to various machine learning and deep learning techniques. Despite their satisfactory performances, they have some pitfalls, e.g., modeling one skill at a time, ignoring the relationships between different skills, or inconsistency for the predictions, i.e., sudden spikes and falls across time steps. For this reason, hybrid machine-learning techniques have also been explored. With this systematic literature review, we aim to illustrate the state of the art in this field. Specifically, we want to identify the potential and the frontiers in integrating prior knowledge sources in the traditional machine learning pipeline as a supplement to the normally considered data. We applied a qualitative analysis to distill a taxonomy with the following three dimensions: knowledge source, knowledge representation, and knowledge integration. Exploiting this taxonomy, we also conducted a quantitative analysis to detect the most common approaches.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Recent studies reiterate the importance of mathematical literacy and the identification of skills, knowledge and cognitive processes which contribute to composite test scores to facilitate targeted remediation and extension activities. To this end, the current article examines data from the 2012 cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), using multilevel modelling techniques to explore the relationship between selected student-level and teacher/school-level factors and the three processes of interpret, employ and formulate which were measured as the skills underlying mathematical literacy in that assessment. Results of the analyses indicate that boys outperform girls significantly (p < 0.001) in all three processes whereby formulate invokes relatively more inter- and intra-level influences compared with interpret. Apart from the relatively higher item-difficulties of formulate, an increase in the complexity of contextual effects at the student and the teacher/school-level emerges as mathematical processes move from interpret to employ to formulate. Findings also reveal that students taught by teachers who had mathematics as a major in their undergraduate studies and who work in relatively smaller classes or groups show higher performance in all three mathematical literacy processes. Use of ICT in mathematics lessons is negatively associated with the three mathematical literacy processes. The additional negative effect of mathematical extracurricular activities at school on the processes highlights the need to rethink how technology and extracurricular lessons are to be used, designed/structured and delivered to optimise the learning of mathematical processes, and ultimately improve mathematical literacy.

- [Optimal and Worst-Case Performance of Mastery Learning Assessment with Bayesian Knowledge Tracing](https://educationaldatamining.org/EDM2013/papers/rn_paper_08.pdf)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    By implementing mastery learning, intelligent tutoring systems aim to present students with exactly the amount of instruction they need to master a concept. In practice, determination of mastery is imperfect. Student knowledge must be inferred from performance, and performance does not always follow knowledge. A standard method is to set a threshold for mastery, representing a level of certainty that the student has attained mastery. Tutors can make two types of errors when assessing student knowledge:(1) false positives, in which a student without knowledge is judged to have mastered a skill, and (2) false negatives, in which a student is presented with additional practice opportunities after acquiring knowledge. Viewed from this perspective, the mastery threshold can be viewed as a parameter that controls the relative frequency of false negatives and false positives. In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding the role of the mastery threshold in Bayesian Knowledge Tracing and use simulations to model the effects of setting different thresholds under different best and worst-case skill modeling assumptions.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Contributions: Prior studies on education have mostly followed the model of the cross-sectional study, namely, examining the pretest and the posttest scores. This article shows that students' knowledge throughout the intervention can be estimated by time-series analysis using a hidden Markov model (HMM). Background: Analyzing time series and the interaction between the students and the game data can result in valuable information that cannot be gained by only cross-sectional studies of the exams. Research Questions: Can an HMM be used to analyze the educational games? Can an HMM be used to make a prediction of the students' performance? Methodology: The study was conducted on (N = 854) students who played the Save Patch game. Students were divided into class 1 and class 2. Class 1 students are those who scored lower in the posttest than class 2 students. The analysis is done by choosing various features of the game as the observations. Findings: The state trajectories can predict the students' performance accurately for both classes 1 and 2.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Massive Open Online Courses ({MOOCs}) have a high attrition rate: most students who register for a course do not complete it. By examining a student’s history of actions during a course, we can predict whether or not they will drop out in the next week, facilitating interventions to improve retention. We compare predictions resulting from several modeling techniques and several features based on different student behaviors. Our best predictor uses a Hidden Markov Model ({HMM}) to model sequences of student actions over time, and encodes several continuous features into a single discrete observable state using a simple cross-product method. It yielded an {ROC} {AUC} (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve score) of 0.710, considerably better than a random predictor. We also use simpler {HMM} models to derive information about which student behaviors are most salient in determining student retention.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This research paper presents an approach for predicting student academic success using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset encompassing students' demographics, academic performance, attendance records, and course engagement, the study employs an HMM framework to model levels of student academic success. Observable emissions derived from the data, such as grades and interaction patterns, are utilized to train the HMM and infer the most likely sequence of hidden states for new students. Evaluation of the proposed model demonstrates promising predictive accuracy. Through rigorous assessment using standard metrics including state prediction accuracy and state transition accuracy, the effectiveness of the HMM in capturing diverse student trajectories is demonstrated, underscoring the potential of HMMs as a powerful tool for understanding and predicting student outcomes, offering valuable insights for educational interventions and support systems.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this paper we propose the use of a latent Markov Rasch model to investigate the development of the achievement level in math of a group of students in Italy. The latent Markov Rasch model may be seen as an extended version of the Latent Markov model (Wiggins, 1973; Langeheine and van de Pol, 2002). The last is a standard tool for the analysis of binary longitudinal data when the interest is for the individual changes with respect to a certain latent status. This model assumes that the response variables corresponding to the different time occasions are conditionally independent given a discrete latent process which follows a first-order Markov chain. In the latent Markov Rasch model a Rasch parametrization is assumed for the conditional distribution of the response variables given the latent process and this process is time-homogeneous. It may be seen also as an extended version of the latent class Rasch (LCR) model (de Leeuw and Verhelst, 1986, Lindsay at al., 1991) in which a subject is allowed to move between latent classes during time. For the application at hand the achievement is estimated by analyzing a set of binary items which are administrated to the same student for more than one time occasion. The measurement of achievements in a longitudinal setting however, typically by cognitive tests, raises thorny problems. Different approaches have been followed to asses this problem. Rost (1989) proposed to treat different time points as independent data. Another way suggested by Meiser et. al.(1995) was to treat each items as a test of its own with t virtual items reflecting participant item responses to the test at each time point. They propose to use longitudinal mixture Rasch model on this type of data structure. Another way proposed by Fischer (1995) was to treat each time point as different items in one long test.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In the global competitive environment faced by educational institutions, operational excellence enables world-class performance. An important task of education planning involves determining the academic progress of students. The present research focuses on the development and analysis of a Markov model to evaluate the academic performance of students in a four-year engineering program in an institution located in India. Initially, the transition probability matrix is developed for the academic progress of students using the frequency matrix obtained from historical data. The probability of movement of students between successive years of the academic program is computed using the transition probabilities. Using Markovian process, the expected number of years spent in a specified transient state before absorption and the probabilities of absorption are determined. The analysis of results reveals that remedial classes and mentoring activities have played a significant role in increasing the graduation probability as well as decreasing the withdrawal probability.

- [`(Not exist)` Student Retention Performance Using Absorbing Markov Chains](https://www.igi-global.com/gateway/chapter/166526)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Performance models are well established in the literature. More specifically, student performance has been of growing concern at all levels. To confront the challenges, researchers have collected data, monitored performance criterion, developed quantitative models, and analyzed patterns to formulate theories and adaptive measures. At the university level, many students' performance deficiencies are keenly noticed and actualized for a variety of reasons. Some reasons may include transition from a home-reporting educational environment to an autonomous setting; lack of a friendly support system; or a host of behavioral circumstances which exacerbate latent academic deficits. One such technique for reviewing student performance can be employed and analyzed using absorbing Markov chains. The use of Markov Chains can provide quantitative information such the characterization potential delays (latency points) within and throughout the system, prediction of probabilistic metrics which define transitions between each stage of a defined state, and adaptability options for enrollment outcomes for use by school administrators. Furthermore, Markov chains can be employed to determine the impact on system resources such as limitations in faculty schedules, classroom assignments, and technology availability. Managers, administrators and advisors may find this information useful when notified of such limitations. This paper is of value to a broad audience such as researchers, managers, and administrators since it augments standard approaches of the Markov model. The blend of stochastic mathematics, applications of stochastic methods and retention theory, as well as the inclusion of adaptive sensitivity analysis are effective performance measures. Therefore, applications in Markov chains and subsequent forecasting models are of contemporary values in educational performance. Each of these concepts and methods contribute to a broader consideration of Markov properties in a branch of mathematics known as Markov Decision Processes (MDP). These types of processes allow researchers the ability to adjust parameters based on rewards, sets of actions, and discount factors. The cases outlined in this paper may be helpful when considering reductions in recidivism rates, improving policies to diminish recidivism, and increasing enrollment options using Markov analysis.

However, their progression is stochastic in nature due to various reasons such as difficulty and number of units of courses. With this, the present study aims to develop a Markov Model to examine the flow of Industrial engineering students in a quarter system. The data used in this research were the enrolled subjects of Industrial engineering students of admission batch 2019 from the first term of their first year up to the third term of the second year, as well as their marks for the said courses. This scenario was modeled as an Absorbing Markov Chain. In the analysis, it was determined that if a student starts his first term in the university, it is expected that he spends an average of 15.5574 terms in the span of the seven terms. Also, if a student starts his first term, there is 29.40% chance that he withdraws and 70.59% that he proceeds. If he starts in the second term, there is 24.99% chance of withdrawing and 75.00% chance of progressing. For the remaining states, the chance of eventually reaching the fourth term of the second year is 100%. Lastly, based on their responses, their failure in courses was mostly due to problems like learning environment and lack of motivation, while they take lesser courses per term due to difficulties in handling multiple courses.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This study analyzes and predicts the academic progress of vocational school of social sciences students in quantitative courses in order to improve student progress in education. A population of 232 students taking commercial mathematics and statistics courses in 2014/2015 academic year is selected. The academic progress of students are estimated by using final examination scores extracted from OGRIS student otomation system of Nigde University. Academic progress is classified with respect to the mean test score as “greater”, “stable” and “lower”. Chi-square test is used for statistical analysis and predictions are estimated by one step stochastic Markov chain model. Direction of academic progress is predicted by the product of the initial probability matrix and transition probability matrix. In 2028-2029 academic year, the probabilities of improvement, no change and decline become stable approximately at 28%, 20% and 52%, respectively. The results are discussed and interpreted.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Students from a middle school (N=152) and from a high school (N=33) completed the same energy-efficient home design challenges in a simulated environment for engineering design (SEED) supported by rich design tool with construction and analysis capabilities, Energy3D. As students design in Energy3D, a log of all of their design actions are collected. In this work-in-progress a subsample of the five most engaged students from both the middle and high school samples are analyzed to identify similarities and differences in their design sequences through Markov chain models. Sequence learning is important to many fields of study, particularly fields that have a large practice component such as engineering and design. Design sequences represent micro-strategies for developing a design. By aggregating these sequences into a model we aim to characterize and compare their design process. Markov chains aid in modeling these sequences by developing a matrix of transition probabilities between actions. Preliminary results suggest we can identify similarities and differences between the groups and that their design sequences reflect important considerations of the design problem. We conclude that Markov chains hold promise for modeling student practices.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In 2011, the Philippine government started transitioning towards a 13-year basic education model which added two additional years of high school to the previous model. This policy change necessitated an assessment of how student progress across the educational system has been affected by the shift in curriculum. One method applied towards similar goals is the use of absorbing Markov chains to better understand the attributes of student flow within an education system. To date, no published work seems to have explored the potential of Markov analysis in the context of the Philippine educational landscape. This study thus used enrollment data from the past decade to construct absorbing Markov models that compared student movement through the Philippine secondary education system before and after the execution of the K-12 program. Results show that although student withdrawals from high school decreased under the new education program, there was a noticeable increase in the number of students repeating grade levels. This insight points to a need for the Philippine Department of Education to reinforce efforts in helping students meet academic expectations and assisting them in finishing school on time.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Higher education in America is characterized by widespread access to college but low rates of completion, especially among undergraduates at less selective institutions. We analyze longitudinal transcript data to examine processes leading to graduation, using Hidden Markov modeling. We identify several latent states that are associated with patterns of course taking, and show that a trained Hidden Markov model can predict graduation or nongraduation based on only a few semesters of transcript data. We compare this approach to more conventional methods and conclude that certain college-specific processes, associated with graduation, should be analyzed in addition to socio-economic factors. The results from the Hidden Markov trajectories indicate that both graduating and nongraduating students take the more difficult mathematical and technical courses at an equal rate. However, undergraduates who complete their bachelor’s degree within 6 years are more likely to alternate between these semesters with a heavy course load and the less course-intense semesters. The course-taking patterns found among college students also indicate that nongraduates withdraw more often from coursework than average, yet when graduates withdraw, they tend do so in exactly those semesters of the college career in which more difficult courses are taken. These findings, as well as the sequence methodology itself, emphasize the importance of careful course selection and counseling early on in student’s college career.

- [Improving Graduation Rate Estimates Using Regularly Updating Multi-Level Absorbing Markov Chains](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7102/10/12/377)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    American universities use a procedure based on a rolling six-year graduation rate to calculate statistics regarding their students’ final educational outcomes (graduating or not graduating). As an alternative to the six-year graduation rate method, many studies have applied absorbing Markov chains for estimating graduation rates. In both cases, a frequentist approach is used. For the standard six-year graduation rate method, the frequentist approach corresponds to counting the number of students who finished their program within six years and dividing by the number of students who entered that year. In the case of absorbing Markov chains, the frequentist approach is used to compute the underlying transition matrix, which is then used to estimate the graduation rate. In this paper, we apply a sensitivity analysis to compare the performance of the standard six-year graduation rate method with that of absorbing Markov chains. Through the analysis, we highlight significant limitations with regards to the estimation accuracy of both approaches when applied to small sample sizes or cohorts at a university. Additionally, we note that the Absorbing Markov chain method introduces a significant bias, which leads to an underestimation of the true graduation rate. To overcome both these challenges, we propose and evaluate the use of a regularly updating multi-level absorbing Markov chain (RUML-AMC) in which the transition matrix is updated year to year. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed RUML-AMC approach nearly eliminates estimation bias while reducing the estimation variation by more than 40%, especially for populations with small sample sizes.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    John B. Carroll’s "A Model of School Learning" proposes a foundational framework to analyze student success and failure in educational settings. Emphasizing the need for a simplified yet comprehensive model, Carroll identifies *learning tasks* as core units of instruction—defined as measurable goals ranging from broad competencies (e.g., reading) to specific skills (e.g., a grammar lesson). The model’s strength lies in its adaptability: it integrates diverse educational research findings into a unified structure while remaining applicable to tasks of any scope, provided they are clearly defined and assessable. By focusing on the interplay of factors like time, aptitude, and instructional quality, Carroll’s work aims to guide both theoretical research and practical interventions in preventing and remedying learning difficulties. This conceptual model serves as a bridge between fragmented educational psychology concepts and actionable insights for improving school-based learning outcomes.

    Private institutions have a challenge to convert incoming students into sophomore status as determined by the critical sequence of courses in their curriculum. The flow through mathematics models the behavior of passing from remedial mathematics courses to second year courses. Quantifying the flow probabilities gives a flow status measure and illustrates the effects of actions to eliminate the remediation steps, thus reducing the attrition rate. At University of Turabo we have experienced an improvement in entry level mathematics though summer seminars and placement tests to shorten the completion time of their career path. The baseline data comes from the 2011 cohort and future cohorts will provide the effects of the treatment. The summer seminars provided by engineering students have had a significant improvement in eliminating steps in the curriculum flow for incoming students (new freshmen or transfers).

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    International students are a small and diverse student population present in any sizable American university. One of the greatest obstacles in their path is the acquisition of the English language. English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programs, such as the English Language Institute (ELI) at the University of Akron, attempt to address this problem. By studying how this student population progresses in their academic studies, EAP programs and their associated universities can make well-informed decisions on how best to serve their English Language Learners. One way to study International students is through the use of a Markov model based on university data. The statistically calibrated model is helpful in that it can reveal at what stage of their studies students are struggling the most or succeeding the most. Our results show that ELI students are well prepared, since international students who are first time freshman seem to have a higher progression rate to the sophomore level than the standard STEM population of students. We also find that students who repeat their freshman year are more likely to repeat again than progress to the sophomore level.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Through the use of three mathematical examples, our study explores the origins of students abilities to model (a) the process in which students acquire the ability to both model and learn transferable modeling abilities across modeling activities, and (b) the way in which the modeling cycle should be characterized. We conclude by suggesting that philosophical issues are present in understanding how the modeling ability emerges in students who have never modelled. This is linked to efforts to find activities and methods that will enable better modeling capabilities to be learned.

- [Knowledge tracing: Modeling the acquisition of procedural knowledge](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01099821)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper describes an effort to model students' changing knowledge state during skill acquisition. Students in this research are learning to write short programs with the ACT Programming Tutor (APT). APT is constructed around a production rule cognitive model of programming knowledge, called theideal student model. This model allows the tutor to solve exercises along with the student and provide assistance as necessary. As the student works, the tutor also maintains an estimate of the probability that the student has learned each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student based on these probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and learning and performance assumptions are described. A series of studies is reviewed that examine the empirical validity of knowledge tracing and has led to modifications in the process. Currently the model is quite successful in predicting test performance. Further modifications in the modeling process are discussed that may improve performance levels.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    It seems likely the magnitude of any causal link between achievement and instruction time depends upon the quality of instruction, the classroom environment and the rate that students translate classroom time into added knowledge. In this article, we use panel data methods to investigate instruction time effects in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment data. The empirical analysis shows that achievement increases with instruction time and that the increase varies by both the amount of time and the classroom environment. The results indicate that school circumstances are important determinants of the benefits and desirability of increased instruction time.

- [Impacts of Students Academic Performance Trajectories on Final Academic Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08744)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Many studies in the field of education analytics have identified student grade point averages (GPA) as an important indicator and predictor of students' final academic outcomes (graduate or halt). And while semester-to-semester fluctuations in GPA are considered normal, significant changes in academic performance may warrant more thorough investigation and consideration, particularly with regards to final academic outcomes. However, such an approach is challenging due to the difficulties of representing complex academic trajectories over an academic career. In this study, we apply a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to provide a standard and intuitive classification over students' academic-performance levels, which leads to a compact representation of academic-performance trajectories. Next, we explore the relationship between different academic-performance trajectories and their correspondence to final academic success. Based on student transcript data from University of Central Florida, our proposed HMM is trained using sequences of students' course grades for each semester. Through the HMM, our analysis follows the expected finding that higher academic performance levels correlate with lower halt rates. However, in this paper, we identify that there exist many scenarios in which both improving or worsening academic-performance trajectories actually correlate to higher graduation rates. This counter-intuitive finding is made possible through the proposed and developed HMM model.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In the proposed work, hidden Markov model (HMM) has been deployed to improve the learner's performance or grades on the basis of their psychological and environmental factors like connect/gather isolation, pleasure/comfort, depression, trust, anxiety, proper guidance, improper guidance, entertainment, and stress. The categorization of psychological and environmental factors has been done on the basis of two factors as positive and negative. The responsibility of the positive factor is to boost up learner's performance or grades, whereas negative factors reduce learning performance respectively. Finally, this paper addresses the application of HMM to determine the optimal sequence of states for different states as grades A, B, and C for different emission observations. The states identification leads to training the HMM model where optimal value of individual states computed using different observation sequences which determines the probability of state sequences. The probability of achieved optimal states is shown in different logical combinations where best state is searched among available different states using different search techniques. The computational results obtained after training are encouraging and useful.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Provision of adaptive and personalized Computer Based Assessment (CBA) services to learners is a multidimensional research field. In this paper we investigate the effect of extraversion and conscientiousness with temporal learning analytics on students' performance during computer based testing. For this purpose, we used the LAERS assessment environment to track the temporal activity - time spent behavior - of 96 students and the Big Five Instrument (BFI) questionnaire to record their personality traits. Partial Least Squares (PLS) was used to find fundamental relationships between the collected data. Preliminary results indicate a positive effect of conscientiousness on (un-)certainty and a positive effect of extraversion on goal expectancy. Further implications of these results are also discussed.

- [Deep Knowledge Tracing with Learning Curves](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10031094)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Knowledge tracing (KT) models students' mastery level of knowledge concepts based on their responses to the questions in the past and predicts the probability that they correctly answer subsequent questions in the future. Recent KT models are mostly developed with deep neural networks and have demonstrated superior performance over traditional approaches. However, they ignore the explicit modeling of the learning curve theory, which generally says that more practices on the same knowledge concept enhance one's mastery level of the concept. Based on this theory, we propose a Convolution-Augmented Knowledge Tracing (CAKT) model to enable learning curve modeling. In particular, when predicting a student's response to the next question associated with a specific knowledge concept, CAKT uses a module built with three-dimensional convolutional neural networks to learn the student's recent experience on that concept. Moreover, CAKT employs LSTM networks to learn the overall knowledge state, which is fused with the feature learned by the convolutional module. As such, CAKT can learn the student's overall knowledge state as well as the knowledge state of the concept in the next question. Experimental results on four real-life datasets show that CAKT achieves better performance compared to existing deep KT models.

- [`(Not exist)` Multi-Graph Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Network for Student Performance Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701484)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In the realm of intelligent education, which is crucial for fostering sustainable student growth, predicting student performance stands out as a pivotal element. At its heart, the challenge of forecasting academic success lies in unraveling the complex, hidden relationships within performance data. While numerous investigations have addressed this challenge, existing approaches often overlook comprehensive, multi-perspective modeling and fail to capture the intricate spatial and temporal dependencies synchronously. To bridge these gaps, this study introduces a multi-graph spatial-temporal synchronous network (MGSTSN) to enhance the precision of performance predictions. By innovatively crafting spatial trend and pattern graphs alongside temporal causal graphs, this approach enables a holistic representation of the diverse spatial-temporal dynamics at play. Furthermore, the development of dual spatial-temporal synchronous graphs and their allied synchronous modules marks a novel strategy for simultaneously learning the interplay between spatial and temporal factors affecting student performance. Rigorous evaluations on authentic datasets reveal that MGSTSN significantly outperforms existing models, demonstrating an 8.17% to 11.34% enhancement across various metrics. This validates MGSTSN’s advanced capability in capturing the multifaceted nature of student performance data.

- [`(Not exist)` Open Service for Video Learning Analytics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6901389)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Video learning analytics are not open to education stakeholders, such as researchers and teachers, because online video platforms do not share the interactions of the users with their systems. Nevertheless, video learning analytics are necessary to all researchers and teachers that need to understand and improve the effectiveness of the video lecture pedagogy. In this paper, we present an open video learning analytics service, which is freely accessible online. The video learning analytics service (named Social Skip) facilitates the analysis of video learning behavior by capturing learners' interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). The service empowers any researcher or teacher to create a custom video-based experiment by selecting: 1) a video lecture from You Tube, 2) quiz questions from Google Drive, and 3) custom video player buttons. The open video analytics system has been validated through dozens of user studies, which produced thousands of video interactions. In this study, we present an indicative example, which highlights the usability and usefulness of the system. In addition to interaction frequencies, the system models the captured data as a learner activity time series. Further research should consider user modeling and personalization in order to dynamically respond to the interactivity of students with video lectures.

- [Prediction of Learning Performance in Online Course Based on Linear Regression Model: IEEE ITAIC(ISSN:2693-2865)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9836468)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper takes the online learning behavior and performance data of online courses as the research object, analyzes the factors that affect the course performance in online learning behavior, and establishes a performance prediction model. First, the influencing factors of course achievement are analyzed by calculating the correlation coefficient between learning behavior features and course achievement; then, a linear regression performance prediction model is constructed by using single or multiple learning behavior features, and the regression coefficients are solved by the least squares method or gradient descent method; Finally, the mean square error and coefficient of determination are used to evaluate the model performance. The experimental results show that the top three learning behavior features that have the greatest impact on course performance are the audio and video learning time, number of chapter study times and the number of task points completed, while the multiple linear regression model established using these three learning behavior characteristics and assignment scores has the highest prediction accuracy. The research results can provide reference for online course teachers and learners, help to promote online course learning early warning and performance prediction, and improve the quality of online course teaching.

- [`(Not exist)` Modeling of Learning Processes Using Continuous-Time Markov Chain for Virtual-Reality-Based Surgical Training in Laparoscopic Surgery](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10016672)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Recent usage of virtual reality (VR) technology in surgical training has emerged because of its cost-effectiveness, time savings, and cognition-based feedback generation. However, the quantitative evaluation of its effectiveness in training is still not thoroughly studied. This article demonstrates the effectiveness of a VR-based surgical training simulator in laparoscopic surgery and investigates how stochastic modeling, represented as continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), can be used to explicit determine the training status of the surgeon. By comparing the training in real environments and in VR-based training simulators, the authors also explore the validity of the VR simulator in laparoscopic surgery. The study further aids in establishing learning models for surgeons, supporting continuous evaluation of training processes for the derivation of real-time feedback by CTMC-based modeling.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Educational big data significantly impacts education, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a crucial learning approach, have evolved to be more intelligent with these technologies. Deep neural networks have significantly advanced the crucial task within MOOCs, predicting student academic performance. However, most deep learning-based methods usually ignore the temporal information and interaction behaviors during the learning activities, which can effectively enhance the model’s predictive accuracy. To tackle this, we formulate the learning processes of e-learning students as dynamic temporal graphs to encode the temporal information and interaction behaviors during their studying. We propose a novel academic performance prediction model (APP-TGN) based on temporal graph neural networks. Specifically, in APP-TGN, a dynamic graph is constructed from online learning activity logs. A temporal graph network with low-high filters learns potential academic performance variations encoded in dynamic graphs. Furthermore, a global sampling module is developed to mitigate the problem of false correlations in deep learning-based models. Finally, multi-head attention is utilized for predicting academic outcomes. Extensive experiments are conducted on a well-known public dataset. The experimental results indicate that APP-TGN significantly surpasses existing methods and demonstrates excellent potential in automated feedback and personalized learning.

- [A Temporal-Enhanced Model for Knowledge Tracing](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-72356-8_27)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict students’ future practice performance through their historical interaction with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). This method plays an important role in computer-assisted education and adaptive learning research. In the learner’s learning process, as the learning time increases, the time distance between the learner’s historical records continues to increase, resulting in a long-term dependency problem when capturing the correlation of knowledge concepts in exercises. In addition, the learner’s learning status is affected by time. How to accurately judge the learner’s knowledge status at different time levels is also a challenge. To tackle the above problems, we propose A Temporal-Enhanced Model for Knowledge Tracing (TEKT). On the one hand, the problem of long-term dependence is solved by using the Probabilistic Sparse Attention mechanism; On the other hand, the Fine-grained Temporal Features are embedded to capture learner’s knowledge status at different time granularities. The method proposed in this paper has been fully experimented and verified on three datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method demonstrates an improvement in Accuracy (ACC) and Area Under The Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics, which compared to the existing KT methods. Thus, it proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- [Time in various phases of self-regulation and problem-solving performance in an Intelligent Tutoring System](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10639-022-11368-y)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The present paper builds on the literature that emphasizes the importance of self-regulation for academic learning or self-regulated learning (SRL). SRL research has traditionally focused on count measures of SRL processing events, however, another important measure of SRL is being recognized: time-on-task. The current study captures the influence of time spent on learning performance. We study time-on-task—from the perspective of self-regulated learning—in the context of clinical reasoning in an intelligent tutoring system. Specifically, we examine the link between the time spent in the three phases of SRL (forethought, performance, and self-reflection) and confidence in diagnosis and diagnosis correctness. Our analyses revealed non-significant links between the time spent in the three phases of SRL and diagnosis correctness. On the other hand, significant associations were found between the time spent in the three phases of SRL and confidence in diagnosis (confidence in diagnosis was: positively associated with time spent in forethought phase; negatively associated with time spent in performance phase; and, positively associated with time spent in self-reflection phase). In addition, confidence in diagnosis was positively linked to diagnosis correctness. Considering learning time offers an alternative perspective on regulation of learning and problem-solving performance. We conclude by offering implications of our findings and recommendations for further research.

- [An improved adaptive learning path recommendation model driven by real-time learning analytics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40692-022-00250-y)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The advancements in the education sector made e-learning more popular in recent years. The velocity of learning content creation and its availability is also growing exponentially day after day. It is challenging for a learner to find a learning path for a course with a vast content repository. So, recommending a learning path helps the learners streamline the learning materials systematically and achieve their goals. This article proposes a learning path recommendation approach focused on knowledge building and learning performance analysis. The model considers both static and dynamic learner parameters for learning path generation. The difficulty level of the learning resources is tuned based on the real-time performance analysis of the students. The learning resources are recommended based on learning preferences and the ability of a learner to learn the specific learning resource. The model also predicts the learning time and the expected score for each learner. Root Mean Square Deviation and Coefficient of Determination (R-Squared error) measures are used to find the correctness of the prediction. The model is also checked for its adaptivity to the learners’ changing behavior and diversity of the LOs recommended for different learners. Ninety-six undergraduate learners participated in the study. The experimentations are conducted with 530 LOs from selected courses. The comparison results with three existing models show a better performance from the proposed approach with an average accuracy rise of 30% in learning path prediction based on the expected duration of learning 27.8% in expected score prediction with the second-best performing model. It is observed that the real-time learning analytics using the implicit learner log data benefits the recommendation process. LO rating strongly indicated the enhancement of learner satisfaction and experience with a rise of 25.5% when comparing the rating share with the second-best model.

    Temporal information plays an important role in student performance prediction, so two interpretable feature factors, namely enthusiasm and stability, are extracted from online and offline blended temporal learning data, which can characterize students’ learning attitudes. A new transfer predicting model called LGES is proposed. The contrast experiments with and without the feature factors, and the experiments with and without transfer learning are carried out. The results show that the proposed model significantly improves the accuracy and the discrimination ability. Furthermore, it confirms that both transfer learning and the two feature factors can effectively improve prediction performance. The ablation experiment of datasets is conducted. It proves that the model trained on the blended data achieved the best performance, and points that the importance of offline data in identifying truly failing students.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In a blended learning environment, student learning necessitates a series of decisions made by students. These decisions include selecting which elements of the blend to utilize for specific learning tasks, deciding when to engage in these tasks, and choosing the appropriate learning aids. While research on blended learning typically focuses on designing these learning environments, it often neglects the examination of their actual utilization. This research, set in a naturalistic setting, investigates various patterns of students’ learning behaviors by categorizing their use of e-tutorial learning activities and their timing across different phases. The study was conducted among 1276 students participating in an eight-week introductory mathematics and statistics course delivered in a blended instructional format. By explicitly distinguishing between the first phase (which involves preparing for a tutorial session), the second phase (focused on preparing for a quiz session), and the third phase (which centers around preparing for the final exam), this study aims to enhance our understanding of the timing decisions students make during their learning journey. Our research reveals the existence of six distinct learning profiles characterized by variations in the frequency and timing of their engagement with learning activities. Moreover, different profiles come with different learning dispositions and cultural dimensions. The primary significance of this research resides in identifying not just the dispositions that are crucial in specific learning processes but also in understanding the role of those dispositions in the timing of the learning experiences.

- [Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Knowledge Tracing](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-022-00297-z)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    As a prominent aspect of modeling learners in the education domain, knowledge tracing attempts to model learner’s cognitive process, and it has been studied for nearly 30 years. Driven by the rapid advancements in deep learning techniques, deep neural networks have been recently adopted for knowledge tracing and have exhibited unique advantages and capabilities. Due to the complex multilayer structure of deep neural networks and their ”black box” operations, these deep learning based knowledge tracing (DLKT) models also suffer from non-transparent decision processes. The lack of interpretability has painfully impeded DLKT models’ practical applications, as they require the user to trust in the model’s output. To tackle such a critical issue for today’s DLKT models, we present an interpreting method by leveraging explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) techniques. Specifically, the interpreting method focuses on understanding the DLKT model’s predictions from the perspective of its sequential inputs. We conduct comprehensive evaluations to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed interpreting method at the skill-answer pair level. Moreover, the interpreting results also capture the skill-level semantic information, including the skill-specific difference, distance and inner relationships. This work is a solid step towards fully explainable and practical knowledge tracing models for intelligent education.

- [Analytical Approaches for Examining Learners’ Emerging Self-regulated Learning Complex Behaviors with an Intelligent Tutoring System](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-60609-0_9)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Self-regulated learning (SRL), or the ability for a learner to monitor and change their cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational processes, is a critical skill to enact, especially while learning about difficult topics within an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Learners’ enactment of SRL behaviors during learning with ITSs has been extensively studied within the human-computer interaction field but few studies have examined the extent to which learners’ SRL behaviors quantitatively demonstrate a functional system (i.e., equilibrium of repetitive and novel behaviors). However, current analytical approaches do not evaluate how the functionality of learners’ SRL behaviors unfolds as time on task progresses. This paper reviews two analytical approaches, both based within categorical auto-recurrence quantification analysis (aRQA), for examining how learners’ SRL complex behaviors emerge during learning with an ITS. The first approach, binned categorical aRQA, segments learners’ SRL behaviors into bins and performs categorical aRQA on the SRL behaviors enacted within those bins to produce metrics of complexity that demonstrate how learners’ functionality of their SRL systems change over time. The second approach, cumulative categorical aRQA, continuously calculates complexity metrics as learners enact SRL behaviors to identify the evolution of learners’ functional SRL. These two approaches allow researchers to identify how the functionality of SRL behaviors change over time in relationship to the occurrences within the ITS environment. From this discussion, we provide actionable implications for contributing to how learners’ SRL functionality can be visualized and scaffolded during learning with an ITS.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In educational assessment, behavioral engagement refers to the extent to which learners actively participate in the assessment process and are motivated to perform well. Behavioral engagement plays a crucial role in the design, use, and interpretation of educational assessments because learners who are engaged in the assessment process are likely to perform better and retain the information being assessed than those who fail to make enough effort when responding to test items. To date, researchers have identified various indicators of behavioral engagement in digital assessments, such as spending sufficient time on each item or task, attempting to answer all questions, and interacting with the assessment environment. Assessment analytics can enable researchers to use these indicators to track, analyze, and interpret learners’ behavioral engagement in digital assessments. This chapter discusses the role of behavioral engagement in digital assessments, including computer-based tests and intelligent tutoring systems. We examine research on behavioral engagement and explain how it can be utilized in assessment analytics. As we describe state-of-the-art methods for modeling and interpreting behavioral engagement, we also present real-life case studies to illustrate these methods.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Knowledge tracing (KT) is an essential task in intellectual education, which measures learners’ ability to learn new knowledge by collecting historical learning information from learners. With the introduction of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Transformer into the field of KT, although effective, they focus only on the temporal order in which the learner information is affected. To model accurately, we propose a KT model BPKT (Bayesian-Attention mechanism Progressive data flow for KT) that allows exercise embedding to be layered in different forms and incorporated into the model multiple times. The BPKT model integrates the relationship between exercises covering knowledge points in both the temporal and spatial aspects, and defines a Bayesian-Attention mechanism based on this, with an in-depth analysis of the realistic meaning of the micro-parameters Q, K, and V in the mechanism. Through experiments on four real benchmark datasets, the results show that the BPKT model is helpful for predicting learners’ future responses on large-scale datasets.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The computational model of school achievement represents a novel approach to theorizing school achievement, conceptualizing educational interventions as modifications to students’ learning curves. By modeling the process and products of educational achievement simultaneously, this tool addresses several unresolved questions in educational psychology through computational modeling. For example, prior research has highlighted perplexing inconsistencies in the relationship between time spent on task and academic achievement. The present simulation reveals that even under the assumption that time-on-task always positively contributes to achievement, the correlations between time-on-task and achievement can vary substantially across different contexts and, in some cases, may even be negative. Analysis of the correlation between prior knowledge and knowledge gains uncovers similar patterns. The computational model of school achievement presents a framework, bolstered through simulation, enabling researchers to formalize their assumptions, address ongoing debates, and design tailored interventions that consider both the school environment and individual student contexts.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Learning interest (internal driving motivation) and learning persistence (explicit behaviors) are important factors affecting students’ academic development, yet whether they operate reciprocally and how to bolster them are still issues requiring attention. This study aimed to examine the reciprocal relationship between learning interest and persistence as well as the potential mechanisms behind the relationship from the perspectives of internal self-regulation and external feedback (i.e., academic performance). 510 students (Mage = 13.71, SD = 1.77, 44.1% girls) were tracked for one year using questionnaires. Results showed that higher learning interest was linked to greater subsequent learning persistence and vice versa; and both predicted each other over time indirectly through academic performance and the multiple mediating paths from strategies for self-regulated learning behaviors to academic performance. Ancillary analysis verifies the robustness of these results. The findings not only provide evidence of a dynamic relationship between learning motivation and behaviors, highlighting the important role of positive performance feedback in leading to a benign cycle, but also contribute to understanding the potential avenue (i.e., teaching strategies for self-regulation) for optimizing student learning.

- [`(Not exist)` Effect of Combined Use of Flipped Learning and Inquiry-Based Learning on a System Modeling and Control Course](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8126236)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Contribution: This paper illustrates how to design and implement curricula in terms of the combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning in an engineering course. Background: Elementary courses in engineering schools are conventional and foundational, and involve a considerable amount of knowledge. Throughout such courses, students are also expected to develop insight, which cannot be obtained by only listening to instructors. Having relevant discussions is also difficult for most instructors. Intended Outcomes: The combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning would be beneficial to broaden student achievement. Application Design: Based on an epistemological approach about knowledge and knowing, this paper applies the combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning to enhance student knowledge and advance ways of thinking on a System Modeling and Control course. Findings: The extended learning time and the collective responsibility for learning are discussed as critical issues in applying the combined use of flipped learning and inquiry-based learning in an engineering school.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Personalized learning paths are fundamental in saving students learning time, an aspect that significantly improves the learning process through appropriate and effective learning models. The contemporary models designed for personalized learning paths primarily focus on knowledge structures and learner characteristics, a factor that significantly ignores the element of critical roles in establishing learning models. In response to these challenges, this study proposes a dynamic model of a personalized learning path that relies on planning algorithms for online learners. The proposed and designed model computes the difficulties of establishing proper knowledge constructs and points, which help address knowledge challenges in the model. Therefore, learning path algorithms are used to normalize the learning process. This factor establishes the need for novel approaches that may be used to automate education management systems. Thus, this experiment revealed that the personalized learning path model designed through a planning algorithm effectively generates a personalized learning model. The findings establish that a customized learning path planning algorithm may improve learning efficiency, effective learning behavior, and course completion rates.

- [Dynamics Personalized Learning Path Based on Triple Criteria using Deep Learning and Rule-Based Method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10322512)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Personalized learning paths are designed to optimize learning time and improve student learning performance by providing an appropriate learning sequence based on the unique characteristics of each student. A common method for constructing personalized learning paths is based on the student's knowledge but disregards the student's interest in the subject matter. This research employs a deep learning and rule-based approach to recommend suitable material based on the topic's difficulty, student interest, and knowledge level. The difficulty level of the topic is predicted using deep learning. A questionnaire is used to determine the level of student interest, which is then processed using a rule-based approach to generate a learning path. Modeling a dynamic learning path requires measuring student knowledge in each topic and updating the learning path accordingly. Comparing the learning outcomes of students who utilized conventional e-learning versus those who followed a personalized learning path constitutes the evaluation. The results demonstrated that students scored 29% higher, or 15.06 points, than those who utilized conventional e-learning.

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This paper presents the results of student engagement with eBRAVO, an Intelligent Tutoring System designed to support students’ development of reading comprehension strategies. The eBRAVO curriculum is a personalized experience based on the students’ previous engagement with the tool as well as their demonstration of deep comprehension of the current materials. This personalization may include support in the form of video lessons that target the comprehension strategy with which the reader has recently struggled embedded within the chapter context the reader was currently working. This paper outlines the results from a deployment during a summer program supporting students reading ecology content, and shows that students are clearly distinguishable into categories that denote their patterns of engagement with these videos. It also discusses how these results connect to comprehension assessment results within the system and at a unit level and the implications these results have for the design of future classroom intervention systems.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In Statistical Inference for Probabilistic Functions of Finite State Markov Chains, Baum and Petrie (1966) establish fundamental results for estimating unknown transition (A={aij}) and emission (B={bjk}) matrices in hidden Markov models (HMMs), where an observed process {Yt} is a probabilistic function of an underlying Markov chain {Xt}. The authors prove that maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) converge almost surely to true parameter values under ergodicity assumptions, using entropy-based arguments H(θ) < H(θ0) unless θ and θ0 define equivalent processes), while also establishing asymptotic normality of the score vector to enable classical statistical inference (e.g., likelihood ratio tests). By leveraging ergodic theory and martingale convergence to derive uniform bounds on conditional probabilities and their derivatives, the work bridges Markov chain theory with statistical inference, providing the theoretical foundations for HMM parameter estimation that would become pivotal in applications ranging from speech recognition to bioinformatics, with proofs emphasizing the interplay between entropy, stationarity, and parameter space geometry.

- [Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0364021388900237)

  <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Considerable evidence indicates that domain specific knowledge in the form of schemas is the primary factor distinguishing experts from novices in problem-solving skill. Evidence that conventional problem-solving activity is not effective in schema acquisition is also accumulating. It is suggested that a major reason for the ineffectiveness of problem solving as a learning device, is that the cognitive processes required by the two activities overlap insufficiently, and that conventional problem solving in the form of means-ends analysis requires a relatively large amount of cognitive processing capacity which is consequently unavailable for schema acquisition. A computational model and experimental evidence provide support for this contention. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
